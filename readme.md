# Lizbeth

A CLI for using the [Robotic Rogerian Therapist, ELIZA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA).

## As a CLI

To install, use [npm](https://npmjs.com) and, in your terminal, type:

    npm install -g lizbeth

Then, you're ready to administer robotic therapy:

	lizbeth
	> Eliza: How do you do.  Please tell me your problem.
	> You: _

You type directly into your terminal to speak with Eliza. Hit enter to tell her what's on your mind.

To stop a session, just type `bye`, `goodbye`, `done`, `exit`, or `quit`.

## Why 'Lizbeth'?

Because it was the first formulation of "eliza" that wasn't already taken in NPM :P
